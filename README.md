# Next.js Demo Playground

This project showcases various features and libraries commonly used in modern React applications. It includes examples of common React Hooks, form handling and validation with Yup and React Hook Form, data fetching with TanStack Query, interactions with Strapi via GraphQL, pagination, Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion and Anime.js for animations. This playground uses Bun as the JavaScript runtime.
